**Speakers:** Leucir Marin, IBM  ( [lmarin@us.ibm.com](mailto:lmarin@us.ibm.com)) and Rahul Gupta, IBM  ( [rahul.gupta@us.ibm.com](mailto:rahul.gupta@us.ibm.com))

**Session Abstract :** In this hands-on lab, you will deploy smart contracts for IoT in IBM Blockchain, and connect MQTT devices to send IoT data to the blockchain using the IBM Watson IoT Platform. In an IoT context, data comes from &quot;things&quot; to private blockchain ledgers for inclusion in shared transactions with tamper-resistant records. Attend this lab and start creating a more efficient business network with the IBM Watson IoT Platform and IBM Blockchain.
